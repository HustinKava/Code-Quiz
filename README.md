<h2>Description</h2>

<p>For this homework assignment I was tasked in creating a coding quiz that incorporates HTML, CSS and JavaScript!</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<p>For this assignment I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and FontAwesome</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>This application is very user friendly and easy to use. User starts the quiz by clicking the "Start Quiz" button which will be followed by an information box. From here you can either click "Exit Quiz" or "Continue". 

Then the quiz box will appear, timer starts, question out of 5 will display and the question will show.

If the user selects a wrong answer, the next button will not show, a red cross will appear and 10 seconds will be subtracted from the time left. However if the user selects the right answer a green tick will appear and the next button will display.

Once the timer reaches zero or the user completes all questions within the allocated time, the results box will show. The results box will display the final score and an input text field for the user to write their initials. User will not be able to click "Submit" unless they enter their initials.

Then the high score box will show and display the user initials and their total score. Scoring is equal to how much time is left. From here user can click the "Clear" button to remove their high score or click the "Return" button to go back to the start screen.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>

<p>I found this assignment challenging but fun being able to display my visual ideas on the screen. I learned a lot and feel a little more comfortable with event listeners and selecting HTML elements with JavaScript</p>
